In 2018, he was named in the FIFA FIFPro World11. De Gea left United following the expiration of his contract in 2023.</p>

He made his debut for the senior team in 2014 and was selected for that year's World Cup. De Gea was named as Spain's starting goalkeeper for the 2016 European Championship and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, receiving criticism for his performance in the latter.[5] He lost his regular place to Unai Simón for UEFA Euro 2020.</p>
